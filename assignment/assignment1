1. Variable and values
    a. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions).
    b. Log their values to the console

2. Data Types
    a. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable 'language', but don't assign it any value yet.
    b. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language' to the console.

3. let const and var
    a. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live
    b. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
    
4. Basic operators
    a. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, then how many people would live in each half?
    b. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console.
    c. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than Finland?
    d. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country have less people than the average country?
